- The Data for the project is created from a original Amazon Ad Camapign dump. The campaigns are mapped into mock campaigns and all reporting metrics are randomised
- The dump file incorporates mapping of ad campaign attributes in the dump file itself from a mock Campaign master and SKU master.
- The dashboard has been been prepared using pivot tables and slicers to filter data. It incorporates all major metrics used in Amazon Ad Performance Reporting segregated them into a **Month to Date Dashboard** and a **Month on Month Comparison Dashboard.**
